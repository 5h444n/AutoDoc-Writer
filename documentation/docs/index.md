# AutoDoc Writer

**Turn your code into documentation—automatically.**

## The Problem
Students and developers often struggle to create proper documentation for their software projects.

* **Student Struggles:** Over 65% of computer science students find writing documentation harder than writing code.
* **Industry Reality:** Software engineers spend around 25-30% of their time just writing documentation.
* **The Gap:** Most existing tools are either too technical or do not generate the formal reports and LaTeX content required for university submissions.

## The Solution
AutoDoc Writer is a desktop application that solves this by connecting directly to your GitHub account.
# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for **AutoDoc Writer**.

## 1. Problem Statement
Students, researchers, and developers often struggle to create proper documentation for their software projects.

* **Time Consuming:** Writing project descriptions, research paragraphs, and LaTeX reports manually takes a lot of time and effort.
* **Skill Gap:** Many students push code to GitHub but fail to produce good reports because they do not understand how to explain their code clearly.
* **Tool Limitation:** Most existing documentation tools are either too technical or only generate simple comments—not full paragraphs or LaTeX-formatted content.

## 2. Motivation
We built this tool because the struggle is real and quantifiable:

* **Student Surveys:** According to surveys from multiple universities, more than **65% of computer science students** say writing documentation is harder than writing code.
* **Industry Impact:** Professional software engineers spend around **25-30% of their time** just writing documentation.
* **Deadline Pressure:** This becomes a major challenge during assignments, thesis submissions, or project reviews when time is limited.

## 3. Solution
**AutoDoc Writer** is a desktop-style application that aims to solve exactly this problem.

* **Tagline:** "Turn your code into documentation—automatically."
* **How it Works:** The application connects to your GitHub account. Whenever you push new code, it reads the changes and automatically generates clear documentation, research-style paragraphs, and LaTeX code.
* **Result:** It removes the burden of manual writing, helping students and researchers produce professional writeups effortlessly.
Whenever you push new code, the software automatically detects the changes and generates:

1.  **Simple Explanations:** Plain English summaries of what the code does.
2.  **Research Paragraphs:** Formal, academic-style writing suitable for thesis reports.
3.  **LaTeX Code:** Ready-to-use LaTeX environments for Overleaf or academic papers.

It eliminates the manual effort of reporting, ensuring high-quality documentation for every single update.
