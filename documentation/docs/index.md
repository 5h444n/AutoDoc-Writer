# AutoDoc Writer

**Turn your code into documentation—automatically.**

## The Problem
Students and developers often struggle to create proper documentation for their software projects.

* **Student Struggles:** Over 65% of computer science students find writing documentation harder than writing code.
* **Industry Reality:** Software engineers spend around 25-30% of their time just writing documentation.
* **The Gap:** Most existing tools are either too technical or do not generate the formal reports and LaTeX content required for university submissions.

## The Solution
AutoDoc Writer is a desktop application that solves this by connecting directly to your GitHub account.

Whenever you push new code, the software automatically detects the changes and generates:

1.  **Simple Explanations:** Plain English summaries of what the code does.
2.  **Research Paragraphs:** Formal, academic-style writing suitable for thesis reports.
3.  **LaTeX Code:** Ready-to-use LaTeX environments for Overleaf or academic papers.

It eliminates the manual effort of reporting, ensuring high-quality documentation for every single update.
